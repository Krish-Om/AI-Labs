\section{Introduction}

Naive Bayes classification represents one of the fundamental probabilistic machine learning algorithms, distinguished by its foundation in Bayes' theorem and the "naive" assumption of conditional independence between features. Despite its simplicity, Naive Bayes has proven remarkably effective across diverse application domains, from text classification and spam filtering to medical diagnosis and recommendation systems.

The algorithm's strength lies in its intuitive mathematical foundation, computational efficiency, and robust performance even with limited training data. Unlike more complex machine learning algorithms that require extensive parameter tuning or large datasets, Naive Bayes leverages probabilistic reasoning to make predictions based on feature likelihood calculations, making it particularly suitable for scenarios where interpretability and quick deployment are essential.

This comprehensive report presents the development and evaluation of two distinct Naive Bayes classification systems: a Tennis Activity Prediction System based on weather conditions, and a Student Admission Prediction System based on academic profiles. These implementations demonstrate the versatility of Naive Bayes across different domains while highlighting the algorithm's practical applications in real-world decision-making scenarios.

The Tennis Activity Prediction System addresses the common recreational decision of whether to engage in outdoor tennis activities based on prevailing weather conditions. By analyzing relationships between outlook, temperature, humidity, and wind conditions, the system provides automated decision support for activity planning. Similarly, the Student Admission Prediction System tackles the complex educational challenge of admission decisions by evaluating student profiles including GPA, test scores, extracurricular involvement, and recommendation strength.

Both systems showcase Naive Bayes' ability to handle categorical data effectively while providing transparent, probability-based predictions that can be easily interpreted by human operators. The implementation demonstrates key concepts including prior probability calculation, likelihood estimation, and posterior probability computation through practical examples.

\section{Theoretical Foundation}

Naive Bayes classification is grounded in Bayes' theorem, a fundamental principle of probability theory that describes the relationship between conditional probabilities. The theorem provides a systematic approach for updating probability estimates as new evidence becomes available.

\subsection{Bayes' Theorem}

The mathematical foundation of Naive Bayes is expressed through Bayes' theorem:

\begin{equation}
P(C|X) = \frac{P(X|C) \times P(C)}{P(X)}
\end{equation}

Where:
\begin{itemize}
    \item $P(C|X)$ is the posterior probability of class $C$ given features $X$
    \item $P(X|C)$ is the likelihood of features $X$ given class $C$
    \item $P(C)$ is the prior probability of class $C$
    \item $P(X)$ is the evidence or marginal probability of features $X$
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Naive Independence Assumption}

The "naive" aspect of the algorithm stems from the assumption that all features are conditionally independent given the class label. This assumption simplifies the likelihood calculation:

\begin{equation}
P(X|C) = \prod_{i=1}^{n} P(x_i|C)
\end{equation}

Where $x_i$ represents individual features and $n$ is the total number of features.

\subsection{Classification Decision}

For classification purposes, the evidence term $P(X)$ can be ignored since it remains constant across all classes. The classification decision becomes:

\begin{equation}
\hat{C} = \arg\max_C P(C) \prod_{i=1}^{n} P(x_i|C)
\end{equation}

\section{System Design and Implementation}

The Naive Bayes implementation follows a modular architecture with clear separation of probability calculations, feature handling, and prediction logic. The system is designed to handle categorical features efficiently while providing comprehensive probability estimates for decision support.

\subsection{Core Algorithm Structure}

        for outcome in np.unique(self.y_train):
            outcome_count = sum(self.y_train == outcome)
            feat_likelihood = self.X_train[feature][
                self.y_train[self.y_train == outcome].index.values.tolist()
            ].value_counts().to_dict()
            
            for feat_val, count in feat_likelihood.items():
                self.likelihoods[feature][feat_val + '_' + outcome] = count/outcome_count
\end{lstlisting}

\subsection{Prediction Algorithm}

\begin{lstlisting}[caption=Prediction Method]
def predict(self, X):
    """Calculates Posterior probability P(c|x)"""
    results = []
    X = np.array(X)
    
    for query in X:
        probs_outcome = {}
        for outcome in np.unique(self.y_train):
            prior = self.class_priors[outcome]
            likelihood = 1
            
            for feat, feat_val in zip(self.features, query):
                likelihood *= self.likelihoods[feat][feat_val + '_' + outcome]
            
            posterior = likelihood * prior
            probs_outcome[outcome] = posterior
        
        result = max(probs_outcome, key = lambda x: probs_outcome[x])
        results.append(result)
    
    return np.array(results)
\end{lstlisting}
