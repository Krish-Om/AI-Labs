# Lab 2: AI Search Algorithms Implementation and Analysis

## Quick Overview

This lab contains a comprehensive implementation and analysis of 8 different search algorithms applied to the 8-puzzle problem, demonstrating both uninformed and informed search strategies.

## Contents

- **`lab/`** - Complete LaTeX report and documentation
  - `Lab2_AI_Search_Algorithms.pdf` - 10-page comprehensive report
  - `Lab2_AI_Search_Algorithms.tex` - LaTeX source
  - `README.md` - Detailed documentation

- **`searches/`** - Algorithm implementations and visual outputs
  - State visualization PNG files for different algorithms

## Key Algorithms Implemented

**Uninformed Search:**
- Breadth-First Search (BFS)
- Depth-First Search (DFS)  
- Depth-Limited Search (DLS)
- Iterative Deepening Search (IDS)
- Uniform Cost Search (UCS)
- Bidirectional Search

**Informed Search:**
- Greedy Best-First Search
- A* Search (with Manhattan Distance and Misplaced Tiles heuristics)
