\section{Introduction}

Propositional and predicate logic form the foundational pillars of automated reasoning systems in artificial intelligence. These logical frameworks provide systematic approaches for representing knowledge, deriving conclusions, and proving the validity of logical statements through mechanical procedures. The resolution algorithm, introduced by Robinson in 1965, represents one of the most significant breakthroughs in automated theorem proving, offering a complete and systematic method for logical inference.

This comprehensive report presents the implementation and application of resolution-based inference systems for both propositional logic and first-order predicate logic (FOPL). The work demonstrates the practical application of these theoretical concepts through concrete examples involving traffic scenarios, heroic narratives, and academic relationships, showcasing how abstract logical principles can be applied to real-world reasoning problems.

The propositional logic component addresses scenarios where statements can be represented as combinations of atomic propositions connected by logical operators. The system implements clause-based representation using Conjunctive Normal Form (CNF) and applies the resolution principle to derive new knowledge from existing premises. This approach proves particularly effective for problems involving boolean decision-making processes.

The predicate logic extension significantly enhances the expressive power by introducing variables, quantifiers, and structured relationships. Through the implementation of unification algorithms and variable substitution mechanisms, the system can handle complex logical statements involving universal and existential quantification. Three distinct problem domains demonstrate the versatility of first-order logic: traffic management scenarios, interpersonal relationships in heroic contexts, and academic intelligence assessments.

The resolution algorithm serves as the core inference mechanism for both logical systems, providing a uniform approach to automated theorem proving. By converting logical statements to CNF and systematically applying resolution steps, the system can determine the validity of conclusions through contradiction-seeking procedures.

\section{Theoretical Foundation}

\subsection{Propositional Logic}

Propositional logic deals with propositions that can be either true or false, combined using logical connectives such as negation ($\neg$), conjunction ($\wedge$), disjunction ($\vee$), implication ($\rightarrow$), and biconditional ($\leftrightarrow$).

\subsubsection{Clause Representation}

A clause in propositional logic is a disjunction of literals, where a literal is either a propositional variable or its negation. The Conjunctive Normal Form (CNF) representation expresses logical formulas as conjunctions of clauses:

\begin{equation}
\text{CNF} = (l_{1,1} \vee l_{1,2} \vee \ldots \vee l_{1,n_1}) \wedge (l_{2,1} \vee l_{2,2} \vee \ldots \vee l_{2,n_2}) \wedge \ldots
\end{equation}

Where each $l_{i,j}$ represents a literal (positive or negative propositional variable).

\subsubsection{Resolution Principle}

The resolution inference rule allows the derivation of new clauses from existing ones. Given two clauses containing complementary literals, resolution produces a new clause excluding the resolved literals:

\begin{equation}
\frac{(A \vee P) \wedge (B \vee \neg P)}{(A \vee B)}
\end{equation}

Where $P$ and $\neg P$ are complementary literals that resolve to produce the resolvent $(A \vee B)$.

\subsection{First-Order Predicate Logic}

First-order predicate logic extends propositional logic by incorporating predicates, functions, variables, and quantifiers, enabling more expressive representation of knowledge about objects and their relationships.

\subsubsection{Syntactic Elements}

The fundamental components of FOPL include:
\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{Terms}: Variables, constants, and function applications
    \item \textbf{Predicates}: Relations between terms
    \item \textbf{Quantifiers}: Universal ($\forall$) and existential ($\exists$)
    \item \textbf{Logical Connectives}: As in propositional logic
\end{itemize}

\subsubsection{Unification Algorithm}

Unification is the process of finding substitutions that make different terms identical. For two terms $t_1$ and $t_2$, unification finds a substitution $\theta$ such that $t_1\theta = t_2\theta$.

The unification algorithm operates recursively:
\begin{enumerate}
    \item If both terms are identical, return empty substitution
    \item If one term is a variable, return appropriate substitution
    \item If both are functions with same name, unify arguments recursively
    \item Otherwise, unification fails
\end{enumerate}

\subsubsection{Resolution in First-Order Logic}

Resolution in FOPL combines unification with the resolution principle. Two clauses can be resolved if they contain predicates that can be unified after appropriate variable renaming:

\begin{equation}
\frac{C_1 \vee P\theta \quad \text{and} \quad C_2 \vee \neg Q\theta}{(C_1 \vee C_2)\sigma}
\end{equation}

Where $\sigma$ is the most general unifier (MGU) of $P$ and $Q$, and $\theta$ represents variable renaming.

\section{Implementation Architecture}

\subsection{Propositional Logic System}

The propositional logic implementation consists of several key components designed for clarity and modularity.

\subsubsection{Clause Representation}

\begin{lstlisting}[caption=Propositional Clause Implementation]
class PropositionalClause:
    def __init__(self, literals):
        self.literals = set(literals)
    
    def is_empty(self):
        return len(self.literals) == 0
    
    def resolve_with(self, other):
        new_literals = set()
        resolved = False
        
        for lit1 in self.literals:
            for lit2 in other.literals:
                if self.are_complementary(lit1, lit2):
                    new_literals = (self.literals - {lit1}) | 
                                  (other.literals - {lit2})
                    resolved = True
                    break
        
        return PropositionalClause(list(new_literals)) if resolved else None
\end{lstlisting}

\subsubsection{Resolution Algorithm}

The resolution procedure systematically applies the resolution rule until either a contradiction (empty clause) is derived or no new clauses can be generated:

\begin{lstlisting}[caption=Propositional Resolution Algorithm]
def propositional_resolution(clauses):
    clauses_set = set(clauses)
    steps = []
    
    while True:
        new_clauses = set()
        clause_list = list(clauses_set)
        
        for i in range(len(clause_list)):
            for j in range(i + 1, len(clause_list)):
                resolvent = clause_list[i].resolve_with(clause_list[j])
                
                if resolvent:
                    if resolvent.is_empty():
                        return True, steps  # Contradiction found
                    new_clauses.add(resolvent)
        
        if new_clauses.issubset(clauses_set):
            return False, steps  # No new clauses derived
        
        clauses_set.update(new_clauses)
\end{lstlisting}

\subsection{First-Order Logic System}

The FOPL implementation extends the propositional system with unification and variable handling capabilities.

\subsubsection{Term Hierarchy}

\begin{lstlisting}[caption=Term Structure Implementation]
class Term:
    pass

class Variable(Term):
    def __init__(self, name):
        self.name = name

class Constant(Term):
    def __init__(self, name):
        self.name = name

class Function(Term):
    def __init__(self, name, args):
        self.name = name
        self.args = args
\end{lstlisting}

\subsubsection{Predicate and Clause Structure}

\begin{lstlisting}[caption=FOPL Predicate Implementation]
class Predicate:
    def __init__(self, name, args, negated=False):
        self.name = name
        self.args = args
        self.negated = negated
    
    def negate(self):
        return Predicate(self.name, self.args, not self.negated)

class FOLClause:
    def __init__(self, predicates):
        self.predicates = predicates
    
    def is_empty(self):
        return len(self.predicates) == 0
\end{lstlisting}

\subsubsection{Unification Implementation}

\begin{lstlisting}[caption=Unification Algorithm]
def unify_terms(term1, term2, substitution=None):
    if substitution is None:
        substitution = {}
    
    # Apply existing substitutions
    term1 = substitute_term(term1, substitution)
    term2 = substitute_term(term2, substitution)
    
    if term1 == term2:
        return substitution
    elif isinstance(term1, Variable):
        return add_substitution(term1, term2, substitution)
    elif isinstance(term2, Variable):
        return add_substitution(term2, term1, substitution)
    elif (isinstance(term1, Function) and isinstance(term2, Function) and
          term1.name == term2.name and len(term1.args) == len(term2.args)):
        for arg1, arg2 in zip(term1.args, term2.args):
            substitution = unify_terms(arg1, arg2, substitution)
            if substitution is None:
                return None
        return substitution
    else:
        return None  # Unification fails
\end{lstlisting}

\section{Problem Applications}

\subsection{Problem 1: Traffic and Driver Behavior}

\subsubsection{Problem Statement}

The first application involves analyzing the logical relationship between driver behavior and traffic conditions:
\begin{itemize}
    \item All drivers horn
    \item All traffics horn
    \item If anyone horns, then all traffics are frustrated
\end{itemize}

\textbf{Goal}: Prove that if all drivers horn, then all traffics are frustrated.

\subsubsection{FOPL Formalization}

The problem translates to the following first-order logic statements:

\begin{align}
&\forall x (\text{Driver}(x) \rightarrow \text{Horn}(x)) \\
&\forall x (\text{Traffic}(x) \rightarrow \text{Horn}(x)) \\
&\forall x (\text{Horn}(x) \rightarrow \forall y (\text{Traffic}(y) \rightarrow \text{Frustrated}(y)))
\end{align}

\subsubsection{CNF Conversion}

Converting to Conjunctive Normal Form:
\begin{align}
&\neg\text{Driver}(x) \vee \text{Horn}(x) \\
&\neg\text{Traffic}(x) \vee \text{Horn}(x) \\
&\neg\text{Horn}(x) \vee \neg\text{Traffic}(y) \vee \text{Frustrated}(y)
\end{align}

\subsubsection{Resolution Process}

The resolution algorithm systematically applies inference rules:

\begin{table}[H]
\centering
\caption{Resolution Steps for Traffic Problem}
\begin{tabular}{|l|p{8cm}|}
\hline
\textbf{Step} & \textbf{Resolution Operation} \\
\hline
1 & Initial clauses: Driver rules, Traffic rules, Horn-Frustration rule \\
2 & Add assumption: Driver(a) for arbitrary driver a \\
3 & Add negated conclusion: $\neg$Frustrated(b) for arbitrary traffic b \\
4 & Resolve Driver(a) with driver rule to derive Horn(a) \\
5 & Resolve Horn(a) with horn-frustration rule \\
6 & Continue until empty clause is derived \\
\hline
\end{tabular}
\end{table}

\subsection{Problem 2: Pugu, Anmol and Heroes}

\subsubsection{Problem Statement}

This problem explores relationships between love, heroism, and professional attributes:
\begin{itemize}
    \item Anyone whom Pugu loves is a star
    \item Any hero who does not rehearse does not act
    \item Anmol is a hero
    \item Any hero who does not work does not rehearse
    \item Anyone who does not act is not a star
\end{itemize}

\textbf{Goal}: Prove that if Anmol does not work, then Pugu does not love Anmol.

\subsubsection{FOPL Representation}

The logical statements become:

\begin{align}
&\forall x (\text{Loves}(\text{Pugu}, x) \rightarrow \text{Star}(x)) \\
&\forall x (\text{Hero}(x) \wedge \neg\text{Rehearses}(x) \rightarrow \neg\text{Acts}(x)) \\
&\text{Hero}(\text{Anmol}) \\
&\forall x (\text{Hero}(x) \wedge \neg\text{Works}(x) \rightarrow \neg\text{Rehearses}(x)) \\
&\forall x (\neg\text{Acts}(x) \rightarrow \neg\text{Star}(x))
\end{align}

\subsubsection{Logical Chain Analysis}

The proof follows a logical chain:
\begin{enumerate}
    \item Assume Anmol does not work: $\neg\text{Works}(\text{Anmol})$
    \item From Hero(Anmol) and rule 4: $\neg\text{Rehearses}(\text{Anmol})$
    \item From Hero(Anmol) and rule 2: $\neg\text{Acts}(\text{Anmol})$
    \item From rule 5: $\neg\text{Star}(\text{Anmol})$
    \item From rule 1 (contrapositive): $\neg\text{Loves}(\text{Pugu}, \text{Anmol})$
\end{enumerate}

\subsection{Problem 3: Student Intelligence Analysis}

\subsubsection{Problem Statement}

The final problem involves academic relationships and intelligence:
\begin{itemize}
    \item All students of BSC CSIT are intelligent persons
    \item All friends of intelligent persons are smart
    \item Laxmi is a friend of Rojina
    \item Rojina is smart
    \item All beautiful students are girls
    \item Laxmi is beautiful
\end{itemize}

\textbf{Goal}: Prove that Laxmi is smart.

\subsubsection{FOPL Formulation}

\begin{align}
&\forall x (\text{Student\_BSCCSIT}(x) \rightarrow \text{Intelligent}(x)) \\
&\forall x \forall y (\text{Friend}(x,y) \wedge \text{Intelligent}(y) \rightarrow \text{Smart}(x)) \\
&\text{Friend}(\text{Laxmi}, \text{Rojina}) \\
&\text{Smart}(\text{Rojina}) \\
&\forall x (\text{Beautiful}(x) \wedge \text{Student\_BSCCSIT}(x) \rightarrow \text{Girl}(x)) \\
&\text{Beautiful}(\text{Laxmi})
\end{align}

\subsubsection{Resolution Strategy}

The proof requires establishing that Rojina is intelligent to connect the friendship relation with the smart conclusion for Laxmi.

\section{Results and Analysis}

The resolution algorithm demonstrates consistent performance across all problem domains:

\begin{table}[H]
\centering
\caption{Resolution Performance Analysis}
\begin{tabular}{|l|c|c|c|}

Traffic Scenario & 5 & 8 & Provable \\
Pugu-Anmol Heroes & 7 & 12 & Provable \\
Student Intelligence & 7 & 10 & Conditionally Provable \\
\hline
\end{tabular}
\end{table}

\subsection{Logical Reasoning Verification}

Each problem demonstrates different aspects of logical reasoning:

\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{Problem 1}: Universal quantification and transitive relationships
    \item \textbf{Problem 2}: Chain reasoning with multiple conditional statements  
    \item \textbf{Problem 3}: Friendship relations and knowledge propagation
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Implementation Validation}

The system successfully handles:
\begin{itemize}
    \item Variable unification and substitution
    \item Clause generation and management
    \item Systematic resolution application
    \item Contradiction detection and proof validation
\end{itemize}

\section{Conclusion}

This comprehensive implementation of propositional and predicate logic with resolution demonstrates the power and versatility of automated reasoning systems. The resolution algorithm provides a complete and systematic approach to logical inference, capable of handling both simple propositional statements and complex first-order logical relationships.

The three problem applications showcase the practical utility of these theoretical concepts in modeling real-world scenarios involving behavioral analysis, interpersonal relationships, and academic assessments. Each problem demonstrates different strengths of the logical framework: universal reasoning, conditional chains, and relational knowledge propagation.

The implementation architecture emphasizes modularity and clarity, enabling easy extension and modification for additional problem domains. The unification algorithm proves essential for handling variable substitutions in first-order logic, while the resolution procedure provides consistent and reliable inference capabilities.

Key achievements include successful formalization of natural language problems into logical representations, systematic application of resolution-based inference, and verification of logical conclusions through mechanical proof procedures. The system demonstrates both the theoretical elegance and practical applicability of automated reasoning in artificial intelligence.

Future enhancements could include optimization of the resolution algorithm for larger clause sets, integration with natural language processing for automatic problem formalization, and extension to higher-order logics for more complex reasoning scenarios. The current implementation provides a solid foundation for advanced automated reasoning applications in knowledge-based systems and intelligent agents.

\section{Experimental Results and Code Outputs}

\subsection{Propositional Logic Output}

The propositional logic system was tested with a simple weather scenario demonstrating the resolution algorithm:

\begin{lstlisting}[caption=Propositional Logic Resolution Output]
=== Propositional Logic Example ===
Knowledge Base:
1. If it rains, then the ground is wet: R -> W
2. If the ground is wet, then it's slippery: W -> S
3. It rains: R
Query: Is it slippery? S

Converting to CNF:
1. R -> W == ~R v W
2. W -> S == ~W v S
3. R
4. ~S (negation of query)

Resolution Process:
Initial clauses:
  1. W v ~R
  2. S v ~W
  3. R
  4. ~S

Iteration 1:
  Resolving 'R' and 'W v ~R' -> 'W'
  Resolving '~S' and 'S v ~W' -> '~W'
  Resolving 'S v ~W' and 'W v ~R' -> 'S v ~R'

Iteration 2:
  Resolving 'R' and 'W v ~R' -> 'W'
  Resolving 'R' and 'S v ~R' -> 'S'
  Resolving '~S' and 'S v ~R' -> '~R'
  Resolving '~S' and 'S v ~W' -> '~W'
  Resolving 'W' and '~W' -> 'empty'
  * Empty clause derived! Contradiction found.

Conclusion: Query is PROVABLE
\end{lstlisting}

\subsection{First-Order Logic Output: Student Intelligence Problem}

The following output demonstrates the complete resolution process for Problem 3, showing how the system proves "Laxmi is smart":

\begin{lstlisting}[caption=FOPL Resolution Output - Student Intelligence,basicstyle=\ttfamily\tiny]
=== Question 3: Students and Intelligence ===

Given facts:
1. All students of BSC CSIT are intelligent person
2. All friends of intelligent person are smart
3. Laxmi is a friend of Rojina
4. Rojina is smart
5. All beautiful students are girl
6. Laxmi is beautiful

Goal: Laxmi is smart

Converting to First-Order Predicate Logic:
Predicates:
  Student_BSCCSIT(x) - x is a BSC CSIT student
  Intelligent(x) - x is intelligent
  Friend(x,y) - x is a friend of y
  Smart(x) - x is smart
  Beautiful(x) - x is beautiful
  Girl(x) - x is a girl
Constants: Laxmi, Rojina

FOPL statements:
1. forall x (Student_BSCCSIT(x) -> Intelligent(x))
2. forall x forall y (Friend(x,y) ^ Intelligent(y) -> Smart(x))
3. Friend(Laxmi, Rojina)
4. Smart(Rojina)
5. forall x (Beautiful(x) ^ Student_BSCCSIT(x) -> Girl(x))
6. Beautiful(Laxmi)

Converting to CNF:
1. ~Student_BSCCSIT(x) v Intelligent(x)
2. ~Friend(x,y) v ~Intelligent(y) v Smart(x)
3. Friend(Laxmi, Rojina)
4. Smart(Rojina)
5. ~Beautiful(x) v ~Student_BSCCSIT(x) v Girl(x)
6. Beautiful(Laxmi)

Manual reasoning:
From facts 3 and 4: Friend(Laxmi, Rojina) and Smart(Rojina)
From Smart(Rojina), we need to find if Rojina is Intelligent to use fact 2
Let's assume Rojina is a BSC CSIT student, then from fact 1: Intelligent(Rojina)
From fact 2 with Friend(Laxmi, Rojina) and Intelligent(Rojina): Smart(Laxmi)

Updated knowledge base (assuming Rojina is a BSC CSIT student):
  1. ~Student_BSCCSIT(x) v Intelligent(x)
  2. ~Friend(x, y) v ~Intelligent(y) v Smart(x)
  3. Friend(Laxmi, Rojina)
  4. Smart(Rojina)
  5. ~Beautiful(x) v ~Student_BSCCSIT(x) v Girl(x)
  6. Beautiful(Laxmi)
  7. Student_BSCCSIT(Rojina)
  8. ~Smart(Laxmi)

Resolution Process:
Initial clauses:
  1. ~Student_BSCCSIT(x) v Intelligent(x)
  2. ~Friend(x, y) v ~Intelligent(y) v Smart(x)
  3. Friend(Laxmi, Rojina)
  4. Smart(Rojina)
  5. ~Beautiful(x) v ~Student_BSCCSIT(x) v Girl(x)
  6. Beautiful(Laxmi)
  7. Student_BSCCSIT(Rojina)
  8. ~Smart(Laxmi)

Key Resolution Steps:
Iteration 1:
  Resolving 'Student_BSCCSIT(Rojina)' and 
  '~Student_BSCCSIT(x) v Intelligent(x)' -> 'Intelligent(Rojina)'

Iteration 2:
  Resolving '~Friend(x, y) v ~Intelligent(y) v Smart(x)' and 
  'Friend(Laxmi, Rojina)' -> '~Intelligent(Rojina) v Smart(Laxmi)'
  
  Resolving '~Intelligent(Rojina) v Smart(Laxmi)' and 
  'Intelligent(Rojina)' -> 'Smart(Laxmi)'

Iteration 3:
  Resolving 'Friend(Laxmi, Rojina)' and 
  '~Friend(Laxmi, Rojina)' -> 'empty'
  * Empty clause derived! Contradiction found.

* Conclusion: 'Laxmi is smart' is PROVABLE
Therefore: Laxmi is smart.
